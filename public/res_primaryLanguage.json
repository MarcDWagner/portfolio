      "description": "ðŸ‘‹ I'm Marc Wagner. I retired 2 years ago from the US Army and since then have been a project manager for a construction testing and inspection company. I am a software developer because I enjoy problem-solving. I specifically chose this field because it allows me to learn new things, always presents a challenge, and I will be able to grow professionally. I am hoping to find a role in an environment where I can work with a small team and see projects from start to finish. I have a lot of soft-skills leaders need to be effective; gained from years of managing and training increasingly larger groups. Thank you.",
